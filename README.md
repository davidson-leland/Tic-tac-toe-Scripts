# Tic-tac-toe-Scripts

This is the first project i worked on in unity.

I Followed a basic tutorial to make a tic tac toe game then added in an AI option.
Most of the work i did is in the TicTacAI file

Though there are two settings for the computer component they are one and the same.

Possible future plans: 
  add in a dumber AI. you won’t beat this one.
	Make it so that the ai won’t always pick the same corner each time.
